This is the Stress modelling project using human physiological signal.

The physiological signals are of following types:-
1. ECG (Electrocardiogram)
2. GSR (Galvanic Skin response)

The following steps are taken for the analysis:-
1. Data Collection
2. Signal Processing
3. Data Cleaning
4. Windowing/ Data framing
5. Feature Extraction
